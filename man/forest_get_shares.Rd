\title{Compute forest cover share by census geography for Montreal CMA}
\usage{
forest_get_shares(
  forest,
  levels = c("DB", "DA", "CT", "CSD", "CMA"),
  chunk_size = 200L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{sf object with forest cover polygons.}

\item{levels}{Character vector of census levels. Any of:
"DB", "DA", "CT", "CSD", "CMA".}

\item{chunk_size}{Integer. Number of polygons per batch in the
intersection with the forest cover. Smaller values use less memory
but are slower.}
}
\value{
Named list of sf objects, one per requested level, each including:
\code{id}, \code{forest_cover_share}, and \code{geometry}.
}
\description{
Uses a forest cover layer (polygons, sf) and returns, for each requested
census level, the share of polygon area covered by the forest cover.
