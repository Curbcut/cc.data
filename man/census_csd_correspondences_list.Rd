\title{Correspondence Tables for CTs Across Census Years}
\format{
\subsection{\code{census_csd_correspondences_list}}{

A named list of data frames. Each element corresponds to a pair of census years, and contains:
\describe{
\item{geouid_21}{GeoUID of the CT in the reference year (2021)}
\item{geouid_XX}{GeoUID of the CT in the comparison year (e.g., 2016, 2011, etc.)}
\item{status}{Indicates if the CT has remained stable or changed ("stable", "changed")}
\item{cma_code}{CMA code used to generate the correspondence}
}
The list is named using the format \code{"correspondence_2021_2016"}, \code{"correspondence_2021_2011"}, etc.
}
}
\source{
Computed using \code{cancensus} and spatial intersections between CT shapefiles.

\description{
A list of correspondence tables matching Census Tracts (CTs) between the reference year (CA21)
and previous census years (e.g., CA16, CA11, etc.), based on spatial intersection.
}
\details{
These tables are used to track changes in CT boundaries over time for consistent longitudinal analysis.
